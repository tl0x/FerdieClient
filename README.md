FerdieClient: Personal project to make mediocre block game cheats (Minecraft)

Want the jar file? You can either build it yourself or go to the "build" folder.

Additionally, if you want the 1.18 version, go to the 1.18 branch. First stable build of 1.18 coming soon.

Not sure if this mod's compatibility with other clients/mods. You'll have to do some testing
